## Code Review Issues:

* **Issue:** The `debug` decorator's `wrapper_debug` function exceeds the recommended line length in several places.  
    * **Severity:** Low
    * **Suggestion:** Break down the long lines into multiple lines for better readability. For example, the `signature` creation can be split.

* **Issue:** While the docstring is present, it could be more descriptive.  It doesn't specify potential exceptions or limitations.
    * **Severity:** Low
    * **Suggestion:** Improve the docstring to include information about potential exceptions (if any) and any limitations of the decorator.  For example:  """Decorator to print function call details, including parameters and return value.  Does not handle exceptions within the decorated function."""

* **Issue:**  No explicit error handling within the `wrapper_debug` function. If the decorated function raises an exception, it will propagate without any additional context from the decorator.
    * **Severity:** Medium
    * **Suggestion:** Add a `try...except` block within `wrapper_debug` to catch exceptions.  Log the exception details along with the function call information before re-raising it. This provides more comprehensive debugging information.


* **Issue:** The code lacks blank lines to improve readability, especially around the nested function definition.
    * **Severity:** Low
    * **Suggestion:** Add blank lines before and after the `wrapper_debug` function definition to visually separate it from the outer function.


## Improved Code:

```python
import functools
from typing import Callable, Any, List, Optional

def debug(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    """Decorator to print function call details, including parameters and return value.
       Does not handle exceptions within the decorated function.
    """
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper_debug(*args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        args_repr = [repr(a) for a in args]
        kwargs_repr = [f"{k}={v!r}" for k, v in kwargs.items()]
        signature = ", ".join(args_repr + kwargs_repr)

        print(f"Calling {func.__name__}({signature})")
        try:
            value = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(f"{func.__name__!r} returned {value!r}")
            return value
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Exception in {func.__name__}: {e}")
            raise  # Re-raise the exception after logging


    return wrapper_debug

```
